# tabou.koplugin

A **Tabou Party** display plugin for [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) — play Taboo around the table with your own card deck.

## Concept

Teams take turns. The active player picks up the device and describes as many words as possible before the timer runs out — without saying any of the forbidden words listed below the main word. Opponents watch for slip-ups and can buzz. Correct guesses score +1, buzzes score −1.

The plugin loads your card deck from a JSON file you place in KOReader's documents folder.

## Rules

- Teams take turns. The active player describes words without saying any of the forbidden words listed on the card.
- **✓ +1** — teammates guessed correctly.
- **✗ Buzzed** — an opponent called out a forbidden word → −1 for the active team.
- **→ Skip** — pass the card, no penalty.
- Play until the timer runs out or the agreed card count is reached; then teams swap.

## Features

- **Card display** — main word large, forbidden words clearly listed below
- **Countdown timer** — 30 s to 2 min per round (configurable)
- **Live scoring** — ✓ +1 / ✗ −1 / → Skip, applied instantly; round delta shown at timer end
- **Auto team rotation** — advances to the next team after each round
- **2–6 teams** — configurable team count
- **FR + EN UI** — interface language switchable; loads `tabou_cards_fr.json` or `tabou_cards_en.json` automatically
- **E-ink friendly** — only the timer digit refreshes in fast/A2 mode

## Card JSON format

Create a file named `tabou_cards_fr.json` (or `tabou_cards_en.json`, or `tabou_cards.json`) and copy it to KOReader's **documents** folder (`/sdcard/koreader/` on most devices).

```json
[
  {
    "word": "Éléphant",
    "forbidden": ["Afrique", "Trompe", "Gris", "Barrissements", "Zoo"]
  },
  {
    "word": "Pizza",
    "forbidden": ["Italie", "Fromage", "Four", "Pâte", "Napoli"]
  }
]
```

Each card object must have:
- `"word"` — the word to describe
- `"forbidden"` — array of words that cannot be said

Cards are shuffled on load and wrap around automatically.
